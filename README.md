# Todo List

This is a website where you can make a todo list with ease! Need to track some tasks and projects?

Click [here](https://mattheweng1.github.io/project-todo-list/) to check out the deployed application.

## Features

- Create and edit projects and tasks.
- Bookmark, change priority, or mark tasks as completed with a single click.
- Local storage is used to save your data, so if you exit the site and return later on the same device, your tasks will still be there.
- Tasks are automatically sorted chronologically, but projects can be organized using the drag & drop functionality.
